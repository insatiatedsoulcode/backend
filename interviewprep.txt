Perfect. Let’s begin Week 1 with a structured checklist and simple actionable tasks to get you moving.

✅ Week 1: Foundation Rebuilding + Setup
Goal: Revisit fundamentals, set up your environment, and create the structure for your credit scoring project portfolio.

🔧 1. Project Outline & Breakdown (Day 1)
Create a 5-part outline of your dissertation project:

Section	What to Fill
Problem Statement	Why credit scoring needed AI improvements
Data Used	Dataset name, number of rows, key variables
Methods	Models/techniques used (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees)
Insights	Main findings (e.g., reduced defaults by 10%, ethical gaps)
Impact	How it helps business (risk management, approval rate, fairness)

✍️ Tool: Use Google Docs or Notion to start this outline.

🗂️ 2. Set Up Your GitHub Repository (Day 2)
Create a GitHub repo like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
Repo name: ai-credit-scoring-project
Folder Structure:
graphql
Copy
Edit
ai-credit-scoring-project/
├── data/                     # Raw or cleaned datasets
├── notebooks/                # Jupyter notebooks
├── visuals/                  # Any charts or images
├── reports/                  # Project summary PDFs or slides
└── README.md                 # Project overview
In README.md, start with:

markdown
Copy
Edit
# AI in Credit Scoring: Business and Ethical Analysis
This project explores how AI-based credit scoring models improve risk prediction, efficiency, and inclusion, using real-world data and ethical frameworks.

## Table of Contents
1. Problem Statement
2. Data Summary
3. Methodology
4. Business Insights
5. Ethical Concerns
🧪 3. Brush Up on Excel + SQL Basics (Day 3 & 4)
Excel (1 hour):
